# ccompiler
A custom compiler built using ideas and templates from the book "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools". 
Much of the code and the grammar for the input language has been modified from the text.

The code generated can be run on a stack virtual machine [(see here)](https://github.com/Mark-Powers/stackvm).
